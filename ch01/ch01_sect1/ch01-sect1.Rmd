# Introduction: What is Behavioral Neuroscience?

#### Where do Behavioral Neuroscientists work?
- **University**: research and teaching
- **Research Institute**: research
- **Pharmaceutical/Biotechnology Industries**: research

#### What other disciplines contribute?
- **Basic Research**: Neuroanatomy, Neurochemistry, Electrophysiology, Developmental Biology, Molecular Biology
- **Preclinical/Clinical Research**: Neurology, Endocrinology, Psychiatry
- integrative function of Behavioral Neuroscience

# Introduction: What is Behavioral Neuroscience?

#### Methodological Approaches.
- **Simplification**: procedures to reduce complexity of experiments without altering level of analysis
- **Generalization**: general conclusions based on many observations

# Biological Explanations of Behavior

#### Methodological Approaches.

**Reductionism**: shift in level of analysis from behaving organism to neuronal systems, circuits, cells & molecules
  
**Explanatory Reductionism**: understanding components of a system that will ultimately explain behavioral characteristics

# Biological Explanations of Behavior

.pull-left[
.content-box-gray[
#### Proximal Explanations
- **PHYSIOLOGICAL**: relationship between behavior and activity of brain/other organs
- **ONTOGENETIC**: development within individual (genes, nutrition, experience, etc.) 
]]
.pull-right[
.content-box-green[
#### Ultimate Explanations
- **FUNCTIONAL**:  purpose served by particular behavior (adaptation for survival)
- **PHYLOGENETIC**: evolutionary organization of the capacity for particular behavior
]]

# Applications of Behavioral Neuroscience

#### The Human Genome Project. 
- structure of DNA published April 25, 1953
- human genome completely sequenced April 14, 2003
- more than 99.99% accuracy
- highly contiguous
- only 1.1 – 1.4% of 3.2 billion base pairs encode proteins
- approximately 24,000 genes
- single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  .content-box-grey[
.font200[![:color red](A) ![:color black](A) ![:color red](G G C T A A)] .font200[` --> `] .font200[![:color red](A) ![:color black](T) ![:color red](G G C T A A)]]
- Behavioral Neuroscientists study functions of mapped genes and their products, interactions of resulting biochemistry with environmental events… as they relate to behavior.

# Applications of Behavioral Neuroscience

#### The Proteome and Connectome Projects. 
- genome project is just the blueprint
- new focus on functional impacts
