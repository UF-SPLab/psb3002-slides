# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Endogenous Cycles. 

.pull-left[
**Circannual rhythms**
- preparation for annual events (migration, mating season, nesting…)
- inputs from sensory stimuli (light cycle, temperature…)
- additional endogenous rhythmicity

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Endogenous Cycles. 
.pull-left[
**Circadian rhythms**
- sleep/wakefulness, body temperature, some hormones
- varies by species, varies by individual, varies if artificially exposed to constant light or dark
- reset by exposure to light

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Free-Running Daily Rhythm. 
.pull-left[
- some slightly longer, some slightly shorter than 24hrs
- in absence of reset, endogenous cycles (e.g. sleep, body 
   temperature, hormones) may desynchronize

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Stages of Sleep. 
- **electroencephalography** (EEG)
    - records mostly cortical pyramidal cells
- **electromyography** (EMG)
    - muscle contraction
- **electrooculography** (EOG)
    - eye movements

- **Electroencephalography**

- **synchrony** = **high 
  voltage** 
      - neurons fire 
  together

- **desynchrony** = **low 
  voltage**
      - neurons fire 
  independently (more 
  active processing)

- **theta** rhythm
    - partially synchronous, 
  large amplitude, SF
    - 5-8 Hz = transition from 
  wakefulness to sleep

  consolidation

    - theta activity, sleep 
  spindles, K complexes

### Stages of Sleep. 
.pull-left[
- **REM** or **paradoxical sleep**
    - rapid eye movements
    - postural muscles paralyzed, loss of tone
    - higher rates of breathing, heart rate
    - higher levels of desynchronous EEG
    - most dreaming and most vivid dreaming
    - generally easier to arouse and will be alert if aroused

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Nightly Progress of Sleep. 
- first 60-90 min, cycle *1-2-3-4* in order
- at end of 60-90 min, rapidly cycle *4-3-2-REM*
- sequence repeats every 60-90 min: 
- *early* in night, 3 and 4 predominate
- *later* in night, 2 and REM increase

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Nightly Progress of Sleep. 
- if sleep deprived, will sleep few additional hours, so only  small portion of deficit is made up
- but % recovery of lost sleep is not equal across stages:
- 7% of stage 1 replaced;	
    - 7% of stage 2 replaced
- 68% of stage 4 replaced; 	
    - 53% of REM
