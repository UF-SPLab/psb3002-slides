# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Endogenous Cycles. 
- circannual rhythms
- preparation for annual events (migration, mating season, nesting…)
- inputs from sensory stimuli (light cycle, temperature…)
- additional endogenous rhythmicity

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Endogenous Cycles. 
- circadian rhythms
- sleep/wakefulness, body temperature, some hormones
- varies by species, varies by individual, varies if artificially exposed to constant light or dark
- reset by exposure to light

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Free-Running Daily Rhythm. 
- some slightly longer, some slightly shorter than 24hrs
- in absence of reset, endogenous cycles (e.g. sleep, body 
   temperature, hormones) may desynchronize

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Reset of Daily Rhythm. 
- light is best cue, can be assisted by exercise, feeding times, etc.

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Free-Running Daily Rhythm. 
- slightly longer than 24 hrs in humans
- approximately 25 hrs on average in 
  absence of reset

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Stages of Sleep. 
- electroencephalography (EEG)
- records mostly cortical pyramidal cells
- electromyography (EMG)
- muscle contraction
- electrooculography (EOG)
- eye movements

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Stages of Sleep. 
- electroencephalography

- synchrony = high 
  voltage, neurons fire 
  together

- desynchrony = low 
  voltage, neurons fire 
  independently (more 
  active processing)

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Stages of Sleep. 
- beta waves:
- desynchronous, small 
  amplitude, VHF
- 13-30 Hz = arousal

- alpha waves:
- partially synchronous, 
  jagged, HF
- 8-12 Hz = relaxation

- theta waves:
- partially synchronous, 
  large amplitude, SF
- 5-8 Hz = transition from 
  wakefulness to sleep 
  and to deeper sleep

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Stages of Sleep. 
- delta waves:
- synchronous, very large
  amplitude, SF
- 1-4 Hz = SWS

- sleep spindles:
- short bursts of 12-14 Hz
- associated with memory
  consolidation

- K complexes:
- sudden sharp wave forms
- promote deeper sleep

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Stages of Sleep. 
- 4 stages of sleep
  + REM in humans

- stage 1:
- theta activity
- average about 10 min
- random thoughts, no 
  dreams

- stage 2:
- theta activity, sleep 
  spindles, K complexes
- average about 15 min
- sleeping soundly, but 
  may report still awake

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Stages of Sleep. 
- stage 3:
- theta and 20-50% delta 
  activity
- average about 20 min
- little sensory input, deep
  sleep

- stage 4:
- more than 50% delta
  activity
- average about 45 min
- difficult to arouse, and if
  aroused may be 
  confused/disoriented

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Stages of Sleep. 
- REM or paradoxical sleep
- rapid eye movements
- postural muscles 
  paralyzed, loss of tone
- higher rates of breathing,
  heart rate
- higher levels of 
  desynchronous EEG
- most dreaming and most
  vivid dreaming
- generally easier to 
  arouse and will be alert 
  if aroused

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Nightly Progress of Sleep. 
- first 60-90 min, cycle 1-2-3-4 in order
- at end of 60-90 min, rapidly cycle 4-3-2-REM
- sequence repeats every 60-90 min: 
- early in night, 3 and 4 predominate
- later in night, 2 and REM increase

# Introduction - Physiology of Sleep
### Nightly Progress of Sleep. 
- if sleep deprived, will sleep few additional hours, so only  small portion of deficit is made up
- but % recovery of lost sleep is not equal across stages:
- 7% of stage 1 replaced;	- 7% of stage 2 replaced
- 68% of stage 4 replaced; 	- 53% of REM
