# Mechanisms of Sleep
### Chemical Control of Arousal. 
.pull-left[
**Acetylcholine**:
- stimulation of cholinergic projections from pons 
   and nucleus basalis induce cortical desynchrony
- cholinergic projections from septum regulate hippocampal arousal

- cholinergic agonists 
  increase arousal
- cholinergic antagonists 
  decrease arousal

**Acetylcholine**:
- extracellular [ACh] in cortex and hippocampus
- high in quiet waking, awake, and REM
- low in SWS

# Mechanisms of Sleep
### Chemical Control of Arousal.

**Norepinephrine**:
- stimulation of noradrenergic projections induces wakefulness
- inhibition of noradrenergic projections decreased wakefulness and increased SWS

# Mechanisms of Sleep
### Chemical Control of Arousal. 
.pull-left[
**Norepinephrine**:
- noradrenergic firing activity is highest in wakefulness, low in SWS, and almost zero in REM sleep
- increases dramatically within seconds of waking
- amphetamine and other catecholamine agonists increase arousal/vigilance

**Serotonin**:
- stimulation of serotonergic projections from raphe to thalamus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, hippocampus, neocortex induces cortical desynchrony

# Mechanisms of Sleep
### Chemical Control of Arousal. 
.pull-left[
**Serotonin**:
- serotonergic firing rate is highest in wakefulness, low in SWS, and almost zero in REM sleep
- increases transiently within seconds of end of REM
- PCPA (blocks 5HT synthesis) decreases cortical arousal

# Mechanisms of Sleep
### Chemical Control of Arousal. 
.pull-left[
**Histamine**:
- stimulation of histaminergic tuberomammillary neurons to thalamus, other hypothalamic neurons, basal ganglia, basal forebrain, cortex induces desynchrony
- some effects mediated directly by histamine to cortex
- some effects mediated indirectly through activation of pontine and basal forebrain cholinergic inputs

**Histamine**:
- activity of histaminergic tuberomammillary neurons is highest in wakefulness, low in SWS, and REM sleep
-  antihistamines increase drowsiness by blocking 
   H1 histamine receptors

**Orexin** (hypocretin):
- stimulation of orexinergic projections from LH to virtually every part of brain 
    - including LC, pons, basal forebrain, where interactions with adrenergic and cholinergic projections 
    - induces excitation

# Mechanisms of Sleep
### Chemical Control of Arousal. 
.pull-left[
**Orexin** (hypocretin):
- activity of orexinergic LH neurons is highest in alert wakefulness, low in quiet relaxation, and very low in SWS and REM sleep
-  modafinil (stimulates release of orexin) 
    - used to treat narcolepsy

**Adenosine** (byproduct of energy metabolism):
- wakefulness increases extracellular adenosine in brain
- adenosine exerts inhibitory actions through ARs
- genetic differences in adenosine metabolizing enzymes may influence individual differences in sleep duration
