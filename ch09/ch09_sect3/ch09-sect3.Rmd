# The Role of Sleep in Learning and Memory
### Sleep and Learning. 
- subjects trained on virtual reality task, then nap
- if awakened during nap (SWS), subjects who reported thoughts related to task did better than subjects who reported thoughts not related to task

# Sleep Across the Lifespan
### Infancy/Adulthood/Old Age. 
- more sleep in infancy than in
  adulthood
- more REM in infancy

# Sleep Across the Lifespan
### Infancy/Adulthood/Old Age. 
- less REM, more frequent nocturnal awakening in aged

# Sensory Processing and Sleep
.pull-left[
### Passive Sensory Theory of Sleep. 
- “Sleep is caused by a reduction of sensory input to the brain (Bremer, 1935)”
- midcollicular transection (cerveau isolé) results in forebrain EEG that is almost entirely SWS
- only interrupted by visual or olfactory input

# Sensory Processing and Sleep
.pull-left[
### Passive Sensory Theory of Sleep. 
- caudal brainstem transection (encephale isolé; cut most of same sensory fibers as cerveau isolé preparation) does not disrupt normal sleep/wake cycles
]

# Sensory Processing and Sleep
### Reticular Theory of Wakefulness. 
- “A wakefulness-producing area is located between the levels of the cerveau isolé and the encephale isolé”
- partial cerveau isolé  only produced constant SWS if lesion included part of reticular formation (RF)
- stimulation of RF awakens sleeping animals
