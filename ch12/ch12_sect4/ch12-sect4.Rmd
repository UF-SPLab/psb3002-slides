# Nutrition and Metabolism
### Neural Mechanisms of Feeding - Brainstem. 
- basic mechanisms of feeding in brainstem
- demonstrated by eating in decerebrate rat
- consumes sweet or slightly salty, rejects bitter
- adjust responses after deprivation or supplementation
- area postrema and nucleus of solitary tract

# Nutrition and Metabolism
### Neural Mechanisms of Feeding - Hypothalamus. 
.pull-left[
- neurons in medulla and hypothalamic arcuate nucleus release neuropeptide Y (NPY) during fasting
- arcuate also releases agouti-related protein (AgRP)
- very powerfully stimulates feeding (orexigenic)

- medulla 
  projections to 
  arcuate
- arcuate 
  projections to 
  LH and PVN

# Nutrition and Metabolism
### Neural Mechanisms of Feeding - Hypothalamus. 
.pull-left[
- NPY/AgRP activate LH neurons to release melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin during fasting
- stimulates feeding (orexigenic)

  cortex, PAG, RF,
  thalamus, LC

# Nutrition and Metabolism
### Neural Mechanisms of Feeding - Hypothalamus. 
.pull-left[
- NPY/AgRP inhibit PVN neurons to suppress release of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and oxytocin during fasting
- removes (anorexigenic) inhibition of feeding

# Nutrition and Metabolism
### Neural Mechanisms of Satiety - Hypothalamus. 
.pull-left[
- leptin binds to receptors on NPY/AgRP neurons and inhibits them (anorexigenic)

# Nutrition and Metabolism
### Neural Mechanisms of Satiety - Hypothalamus. 
.pull-left[
- arcuate neurons release α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) after feeding
- blocks feeding (anorexigenic)

- projections to
  LH and PVN
